<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>1. Create a class "BankAccount" with attributes account number and balance. Implement methods to deposit and withdraw funds, and a display method to show the account details.</p>
<p>2. Create a base class "Shape" with methods to calculate the area and perimeter (pure virtual). Implement derived classes "Rectangle" and "Circle" that inherit from "Shape" and provide their own area and perimeter calculations.</p>
<p>3. Create a class "Person" with a static member variable "count" that keeps track of the number of instances created.</p>

<h2>Coding platform used</h2>

<h2>Approach used</h2>
<p>1. Created class, attributes and methods as said, for deposit added given amount to balance of user and for withdrawl subtracted amount from user's balance. For siplaying simple printed the user's data.</p>
<p>2. Created class, attributes and virtual functions by using virtual keyword with = 0 for making it pure virtual. Simply did inherticance and call required methods.</p>
<p>3. Created a class, and static variable - initialize it outside the class so that it's value can be accessed and modified by instances of that class.</p>
